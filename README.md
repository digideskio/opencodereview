# opencodereview

A platform for finding code reviewers for your project.

Developers often work on their Open Source project and want
input or a code review for their project.
However finding a reviewer becomes tricky if you don't know
the people personally.

A platform where reviewable projects and reviewers find each
other would solve that problem and improve the quality
of Open Source projects.

In order to review projects or get your project reviewed
you simply sign up with your GitHub account.

The web application is only the mediator between
the reviewer and the project. The review itself can happen
anywhere (via GitHub issue, email or blog post).

The platform helps matching appropriate projects to
appropriate viewers by looking at following qualifiers:
- Similarity in projects (many Django projects)
- Expertise in Language (via published repositories)
- Developers with more stars are usually more popular
- Location / Language (preferably from same country or region)
